      <h1> About Venuetrack </h1>
      <p>The world wide web has been rapidly expanding over the last decade, and today more than 40% of
      the world population is using it on a daily basis. Social media have played a very important part in
      this increase of the internet’s popularity, since for many people, social media is one of the few if
      not the only reason to go online. As a result of this explosion, large quantities of raw data have
      been produced, and its analysis is a huge challenge for the scientific community. In this context,
      sentiment analysis and natural language processing are in the center of the scientific status qwo,
      presenting great interest and vast new opportunities. Especially so in Greece, where these fields
      are still relatively evolving in a very slow pace.</p>
      <p>For that reason, this thesis tries to develop a sentiment analysis system, by using natural language
      processing methods. The aim of this thesis, is to apply sentiment analysis in order to evaluate
      points of interest (or venues) in the city of Thessaloniki, by evaluating users’ comments. These
      comments are categorized as positive or negative by a classifier that was developed and trained
      using a relevant dataset. By using the classifier to evaluate each venue’s comments, we then
      decide if each venue offers a positive or negative experience to the visitor.</p>
      <p>The results of this NLP system are presented in a web application named Venuetrack. Venuetrack
      is a smart and easy-to-use search engine for venues in the city of Thessaloniki, in which users can
      search for points of interest on the map of Thessaloniki, and check out their information as well as
      the classification of the NLP classifier created.</p>
